# OOP
# This is the project that works with object-oriented programming

This is a project which gets information from architects, contractors and customers.
In this program we create methods that can store such information in variables.
We then later call these methods by the variable later in the task.
This is all stored from the users input.

This program collects information from all these architects, contractors and customers such as name, surname, number, etc...
This program also allows the user to:
* Edit contractors details,
* Edit deadline date,
* Edit amount paid,
* Finalize a project, which will print the invoice
